Fixed README file.

Greetings! My name is Navin Doobay, and here is my starter data science project using files provided to me by Cisco Networking Academy.

In this project, I will analyze the largest islands in the world using Python libraries pandas and matplotlib to answer the following countries:
    1. What are the 10 largest islands in the tropics ?
    2. What are the largest islands in each region?
    3. Visualizing this data will help tremendously in finding potential patterns.
    4. Find islands that are composed of multiple countries.

Coding Language/ libraries used:
    1. Python
    2. pandas
    3. matplotlib
    4. Jupyter Notebook

Files:
    'largest_islands_analysis.ipynb': main notebook for analysis
    'largest-islands.csv' – Dataset
